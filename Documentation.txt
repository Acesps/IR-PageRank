					PageRank SYSTEM
This system is a implimentation of PageRank algorithm.

There are total of 2 modules in the system which inturn imports many modules.
Modules are: 
	PageRank
	visualize

PageRank module uses 4 modules namely:
	1.networkx
	2.matplotlib.pyplot
	3.random
	4.pylab

	There is only one fuunction in module:initialize_graph(outlinks,layout="xNotAsCentre")
		The Function returns a networkx Digraph, a list of nodes in it and layout positions  
		it takes 2 arguments, first is list of outlinks from one node to another
		other argument is a string that tell weather the random node should be in 
		centre of graph generated or not. 
		The other nodes are picked accordingly.
		This function picks nodes, add their edges and decide position for nodes in 
		graph using fuctions from networkx libarary.
		layout for node position is chosen as spring
	The rest of the code is module reads the contents of file "web-Stanford.txt" 
	from the same folder and builds a graph from it.
	Now the graph is itarated to fill values in outLinks and inLinks list of lists.
	The PageRank is initialized to avg value.
	All the nodes that are Deadends and do not point to any other pages are collected in the DeadEnds list 
	The initialize_graph function is called.
	Then the page rank is calculated using inLinks, outLinks and older PageRank and the enhanced PageRank equation till PageRank converges.
	The summation of PageRanks of Deadends is calculated only once in each iteration.
	The PageRank of random nodes are visualized on every alternate iteration.
	The runing time of algorithm including the visualization time is displayed at the end.


visualize module uses 3 python modules:
	1.networkx
	2.matplotlib.pyplot
	3.pylab
	There is only one function in module: visualize(PageRank,G,nodes,graph_pos,node_color='red', node_alpha=0.3,
               node_text_size=12,
               edge_color='blue', edge_alpha=0.3, edge_tickness=1,
               edge_text_pos=0.3,
               text_font='sans-serif')      

        This function runs 3 functions:
       		nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G,graph_pos,node_size=node_size,alpha=node_alpha, node_color=node_color)
			nx.draw_networkx_edges(G,graph_pos,width=edge_tickness,alpha=edge_alpha,edge_color=edge_color,arrows=True)
			nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, graph_pos,font_size=node_text_size,font_family=text_font)
	    Documentation of these functions can be found at  
	    https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.7/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx_nodes.html
	    https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx_edges.html
	    https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx_labels.html

	    This function sets value of node size accoring to its PageRank and normalizes it.



Documentaion of 4 modules used can be found at:
	networkx:	https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/
	matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/contents.html
	random: 	https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html
	pylab:		Pylab is basically just Numpy and matplotlib under a unified namespace.
